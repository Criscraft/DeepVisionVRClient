# DeepVisionVR - Client

The [DeepVisionVR](https://github.com/Criscraft/DeepVisionVR) project visualizes deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in 3D. Take a walk in your CNN and interact with it to get a more intuitive understanding of Deep Learning or to analyze your models.

This repository contains the *client* part of the project, which contains the Unity project to display and interact with artificial neural networks. Virtual Reality and desktop modes are available. The software uses the OpenXR framework. The Server can be found [HERE](https://github.com/Criscraft/DeepVisionVRServer).

## Requirements

Please install the most recent release of the client (see releases). There is a version for VR and for desktop mode, respectively.

For development:
Please install Unity 2021.3.9f1 via [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).

## Get started

Simply run the client. If you have no VR Headset connected, the application will start desktop mode. Before running the client, make sure that the server is set-up and running.
